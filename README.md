Bank Customer Churn Prediction Model


Overview :
This project implements a machine learning model to predict customer churn in a bank setting. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers leave a service provider over a given time period.


Dataset:
The model is trained on a dataset containing various features related to customer behavior, demographics, and transaction history.


Tools and Libraries Used:

*Python

*Jupyter Notebook

*Scikit-learn

*Pandas

*Matplotlib

*Seaborn

Model Building:

Data Preprocessing:
Cleaning, transforming, and encoding features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyzing patterns and relationships in the data.

Feature Engineering: 
Creating new features to improve model performance.

Model Selection: 
Testing multiple machine learning algorithms.

Model Evaluation:
Evaluating models using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC AUC.

Usage:
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/rahul02235/Bank-Customer-Churn-Model.git

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Results:

Discuss the performance metrics of the final model.

Visualizations of key insights from the data and model predictions.

Future Work:

Plans for improving model accuracy or deploying it in a real-world scenario.

Additional features to explore for better prediction.
